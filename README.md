# Goodness-of-fit

Exercise: to do estimation of parameters and perform the goodness of fit using Chi-square and student's t tests.
1. Continuous: Assume Gaussian and Beta distributions.
2. Discrete: Assume Binomial/multinomial and Poisson distributions. 
Parameter Estimation methods to be used:
1. Maximum Likelihood.
2. Method of moments.
